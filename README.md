# BP Multiblog Mode #

Enable and customize BuddyPress on other sites than the root blog.

## Description ##

> This WordPress plugin requires at least [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) 4.6 and [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org) 2.7.

Wanting to have BuddyPress run on your subsites, but not all of them? Instead of defining the `BP_ENABLE_MULTIBLOG` constant, with this plugin you can choose on which sites BuddyPress acts like `BP_ENABLE_MULTIBLOG` was defined. In addition, this plugin allows you to:

* Define Extended Profile field groups per site
* Limit Activity Stream items to those belonging to the current site
* [more to come]

Note that you need to have BuddyPress network-activated in your Multisite installation for this plugin to work.

## Installation ##

If you download BP Multiblog Mode manually, make sure it is uploaded to "/wp-content/plugins/bp-multiblog-mode/".

Activate BP Multiblog Mode in the "Plugins" network admin panel using the "Network Activate" link. You need to use WordPress Multisite, for this plugin to work. Additionally, you need to have BuddyPress network-activated in you Multisite installation, and not have defined the `BP_ENABLE_MULTIBLOG` constant manually.
